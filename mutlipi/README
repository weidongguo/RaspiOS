MULTIPI - Multi Core examples for Raspberry Pi 2
------------------------------------------------

Raspberry Pi 2 board comes with a quad core Cortex-A7 controller. This is a really good board to learn multi core programming.


Folders
-------

sd_card - Contains the files needed to be copied to your SD card along with the kernel.img file inside the example folders

openocd_cfg - configuration files needed by OpenOCD to debug Raspberry Pi via JTAG

Example_00 - This is just a blink LED example by Core 0. Move ahead to next examples!

Example_01 - Each core blinks its corresponding LED.

Example_02 - 4 Cores blinks the ACT_OK LED one after the other. Count of the blink represents which core is blinking the LED. Core 0 will blink the LED 1 time then Core 1 will blink the LED 2 times and so on..

Example_03 - Core 1,2,3 tries to write in a same RAM location. Core 0 monitors who won in writing and blinks the ACT_OK LED based on it. Also Core 0 sends the data via UART.

Building the examples
---------------------

1) Download the toolchain from https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded

2) Update PATH variable so that the Makefile can find the arm-gcc tools

3) Run the below commands in shell
make clean
make
