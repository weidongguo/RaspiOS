Following pins are required to access JTAG

All these signals can be accessed in the Alternate Function 4 (except VCC and GND)

JTAG signal | RPi GPIO
----------------------
 TRST       | GPIO22
 TDI        | GPIO26
 TMS        | GPIO27
 TCK        | GPIO25
 TDO        | GPIO24
 
 --DON'T CONNECT TO 5V SINCE RASPBERRY PI IS 3.3V--
 
 VREF  Pin1(3.3 V) of the header
 GND   Pin 39 of the header
